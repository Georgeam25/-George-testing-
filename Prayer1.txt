God i love you so much and i need you in my live 
i feel lost and depressed 
Show yourself to me Lord and strenghten me 
The devil has concured me and succeeded in making me feel lonley and afraid but you are my strenght 
i believe in you and your infinite power and love to me Lord 
please don't forsake me 
I feel abandoned and betrayed
Please look down at me , Forgive my sings and draw me close to you Lord 
I need to find the purpose of my life here on earth 
I also want to be a good father & Husband and above all server you Lord
